Have questions? [Let's chat](https://cal.com/natew).

Watch the [One promo video and demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJH4bKkwo90).

## What is One?

One makes it much simpler to build cross-platform apps using the most popular technologies to do so today: React, and React Native. One requires less code yet outputs better performance thanks to our partnership with [Zero](https://zerosync.dev) and our [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) library.

Most people don't even try going cross-platform because of how hard it is, and the biggest reason is you need two separate frameworks - Metro for Native, something like Next.js for web.

This is a huge source of complexity. Every step of the way is painful. Two folders in a complex monorepo, two sets of documentation, two ways to route, two ways to configure, two bundlers, etc.

One turns two painful things into one much simpler one.

## Product Status

One makes cross-platform as simple as single-platform, and does so with incredible performance and incredibly simple code thanks to our partnership with [Zero](https://zerosync.dev) and our [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) library.

One launched in beta Oct 3 and is production-ready for web, Native support should be production within 3 months.

Because the One framework itself uses Zero, we don't see a need to ship the highly complex React Server Components, as most of the competition is. This saves effort so we can invest into differentiating features.

One plans to launch a SaaS ("One Up") that will do three things: deployment, hosting and AI. One Up hosting, with your investment, should be able to launch in private beta within 6 months, with a public launch before end of 2025.

## Competition

On the framework level, Expo with Expo Router. With the SaaS, we will compete with Vercel, AWS and similar.

Expo has many focuses - EAS, their build service, Expo Updates, and a wide ecosystem of packages they maintain. They are building Expo Router by attempting to make Metro work for web, but Metro is far behind Vite in almost every way, but especially in mind-share - even the creator of Metro asked me to "please kill it."

Our advantages are in simplicity and vertical integration.

Our development of Tamagui helps, as it's the only universal style library that makes native development feel as good as web, key to expanding React Native's reach.

## The Challenge

The main challenge of One is to build the best framework, cloud, and development environment by a large margin. We think we do so with vertical integration and avoiding the [accidental complexity](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

### One Up

We'll simplify two complex things into one by making `one` locally be the same as `one up` in production.

We have a simple way to make multi-service hosting as simple as current great single-service clouds like Vercel/Railway/Heroku.

By doing both of the above we can build perfect preview environments clean data on every PR, and have many interesting opportunities for better internal tools and admin interfaces.

### AI

Most developer-focused AI tools are limited in context (think: Copilot in your editor, v0 in your browser, Warp in your CLI). One AI (name tbd) knows your whole stack - including your actual running apps.

We think there's a big opportunity to build a great code dev tool, especially with the new Llama models that make SoTA text, context and vision much cheaper and more accessible, but it will be difficult.

## Business Model

We give away One, developer content, and the local One Up.

We sell One Up cloud in parts: previews, hosting, and AI.

With tech advances in the last decade, a lack of cruft, and going vertically integrated, we can ship a better cloud experience with much less resources than Vercel (I saw firsthand how complex it was working there).

## Company Structure

OneJS is an S-Corp. Nate Wienert is the sole founder, and our team currently consists of two other talented software developers that are keys to success as they are great, and took much hiring and firing to find.

## Company Culture

Hire the most effective, good people we can find, focus on hard but inspiring problems, and focus on quality so we can take pride in what we do.

I work from Hawaii and find great people are all over the world, so remote culture is fine, but we'll make in-person co-working a 2-3 time a year tradition.

## What We are Offering

We are offering a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) with a target raise of $5 million in exchange for 10% equity in the company. This SAFE will convert to equity at the next priced round.

## What We are Asking

- If you are receiving this document we think you are a valuable investor. 
- We want people who understand the devtools space and our product and have either insight or connections in the space so we can rely on them at critical times for advice or introductions.
- We appreciate investors who have experience scaling, marketing, and hiring for dev tools.
- We'd appreciate introduction to other investors you think fit this profile well.
- We need investors who are not conflicted: that means no investments into Vercel or Expo, or similar.

## Potential Returns

Tamagui makes a modest $200k ARR (it has only ever been a side-project alongside a full-time job). We plan to make the current Tamagui products mostly free going forward to increase our top of funnel. We think One Up cloud hosting and PR preview service will be able to very quickly scale up revenue.

## Current Interest

[todo] We have over 15 angel VCs in the dev tools space interested, but we just starting. We previously raised and have good relations with Founders Fund.

## Use of Funds

- **Staff**: Our two remote employees currently are at ~$72k/year each, we will raise them to ~$90k/year for retention and give them some equity. US based employees will earn $250k/year as we aim to attract the very best. We aim to hire at most mostly US based, no more than 25% remote.

- **Marketing**: We plan to spend $250k in the first year on high quality developer content.

- **Infra**: Once One Up launches we will need to pay for it's infrastructure, but this should be covered entirely by the subscriptions. We are exploring running it more cheaply by managing Hetzner servers, but haven't vetted this out fully yet.

## Roadmap

- One beta: out now
- One 1.0: ideally 3 months, max 6.
- One Up: beta in 6 months, public within a year.
