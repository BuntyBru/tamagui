# Tamagui UI

<Description>
  Fully open source composable components for all&nbsp;React&nbsp;platforms.
</Description>

Tamagui UI is an open source collection of "[composable components](https://dev.to/haribhandari/react-build-your-own-composable-headless-components-170b)" that all render universally - ie on React web and React Native at once. Some components render the same on all platforms, but many now [Adapt](docs/components/popover) to render as different components depending on platform or capability. And a few even have native adaptations that let you render for example your Sheet contents into native iOS modals.

All components in the kit can be installed independently, or you can install them all at once with:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

## Setup

The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`, so if you've already installed core you can change all the references to `tamagui`.

You'll need to add a provider for usage of the full component kit as it will set up the root portal for components like dialogs and popovers.

```tsx
import { TamaguiProvider, View } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={yourConfig}>
    <View />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

See [the configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration) for how to set up `yourConfig`.
